It is difficult for many students to master basic concepts in computer science and programming. A large portion of the confusion can be blamed on the complexity of the tools and materials that are traditionally used to teach CS1 and CS2. This textbook was written with a single overarching goal: to present the core concepts of computer science as simply as possible without being simplistic.",

It is described as a high-level programming scripting language but may also be put to use for non-scripting contexts. It is different from other programming languages since it embraces code readability and the ability to express programming language using only a few lines of codes. Python intents to create clearer programs for small programming uses as well as for complex and large scale programming use. Python supports several programming concepts: it may be applied to object oriented programming, imperative-styles as well as functional programming.",

Explore different programming paradigms and find the best approach to a situation; understand how to carry out performance optimization and effective debugging; control the flow of a program; and utilize an interchange format to exchange data. You'll also walk through cryptographic services in Python and understand secure tokens. Learn Python Programming will give you a thorough understanding of the Python language. You'll learn how to write programs, build websites, and work with data by harnessing Python's renowned data science libraries. Filled with real-world examples and projects, the book covers various types of applications, and concludes by building real-world projects based on the concepts you have learned. What you will learn Get Python up and running on Windows, Mac, and Linux Explore fundamental concepts of coding using data structures and control flow Write elegant, reusable, and efficient code in any situation Understand when to use the functional or OOP approach Cover the basics of security and concurrent/asynchronous programming Create bulletproof, reliable software by writing tests Build a simple website in Django Fetch, clean, and manipulate data Who this book is for Learn Python Programming is for individuals with relatively little experience in coding or Python. It's also ideal for aspiring programmers who need to write scripts or programs to accomplish tasks. The book shows you how to create a full-fledged application.",

    "description": "A user-friendly, object-oriented language, Python is quickly becoming the favorite introductory programming language among students and instructors. Many find Python to be a more lucid language than Java but with much of the functionality and therefore the ideal first language for those entering the world of Computer Science. Python Programming in Context is a clear, accessible introduction to the fundamental programming and problem solving concepts necessary for students at this level. The authors carefully build upon the many important computer science concepts and problem solving techniques throughout the text and offer relevant, real-world examples and exercises to reinforce key material. Programming skills throughout the text are linked to applied areas such as Image Processing, Cryptography, Astronomy, Music, the Internet, and Bioinformatics, giving students a well rounded look of its capabilities.",

This book can be manual for those who would want to excel in Python programming as well as for those who are new to Python programming and would want to learn. I hope that you will find what follows both instructive and at times entertaining too. The book is designed for programmers who already have some experience of using a modern high level procedural programming language like C/ C++. The book concentrates on the things that are essential to understand Python programming. Those who already know C will find the contents and example code snippets a bit interested. The syntax and coding constructs of Python programming paradigm is nearer to C but not exact. From my point of view, what matters for a programmer is \"Logic\" and \"Syntax\". It has been inevitable for programmers to learn and practice emerging programming paradigms. This is the first edition of the textbook hence a lot of brainstorming was required in order to properly structure each and every chapter. Appendix A addresses exercise questions of \"Python for Everybody\" by Charles R Severance. Appendix B is about Python solution to few commonly found programming problems. All the programs presented in the textbook are tested using PyCharm IDE. I hope the book meets the requirements of student fraternity and remains reachable throughout its multiple entry of editions. Also, PyCharm IDE installation guidelines included in the textbook.",
